# Corne + 2 PSP joysticks/dual trackpoint (Rust/RMK)

I wanted to have a ThinkPad like experience with my first ergo keyboard, because
I really liked the trackpoint. I got these PSP joysticks for really cheap and
they work even better than a trackpoint. Because I couldn’t get zmk or qmk to
work correctly with this custom design, I just wrote the Rust code myself using
RMK (this allows me to use the keyboard both in wired and wireless mode without
any compromises and both joysticks work fine).

I used a 3d print design I found online and extruded it upwards to fit two
2000mAh lithium ion batteries (this made the keyboard kinda chunky).
